# Hi, I'm Shivam Chhetry ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist with a deep curiosity for AI and machine learning, driven by a passion for understanding how these technologies can reshape the world. My journey into coding started early, leading me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Over the last year, Iâ€™ve been fully immersed in Data Science, diving into the research and applications of AI to solve real-world problems.

I approach problems with a mindset inspired by the Japanese concept of **Kata**â€”embracing continuous learning, deliberate practice, and steady improvement. As a researcher, I thrive on tackling difficult questions, running experiments, and refining my methods to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in AI.

## What Iâ€™m Working On
- **AI Research**: Iâ€™m particularly focused on exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of AI models. This includes studying the behaviors of machine learning algorithms in complex spaces, investigating how models generalize, and trying to uncover ways to improve their robustness and interpretability.
- **Machine Learning**: In addition to conducting experiments on state-of-the-art algorithms, I enjoy building machine learning models that can learn from real-world data and apply that knowledge to practical use cases.
- **Staying on the Cutting Edge**: Iâ€™m constantly reading the latest research papers, attending webinars, and engaging with the AI community to ensure that my work is aligned with the most recent breakthroughs and trends.

## My Research Interests
- **AI Model Interpretability**: Iâ€™m deeply interested in understanding how complex machine learning models like deep neural networks make decisions, and how we can improve their transparency without sacrificing performance.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Investigating how we can develop models that learn from unstructured dataâ€”whether through self-supervised learning, clustering, or dimensionality reductionâ€”without the need for large labeled datasets.
- **AI Ethics**: I'm passionate about the ethical implications of AI, from biases in algorithms to the societal impact of automation, and am dedicated to ensuring that AI advancements are both fair and responsible.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Iâ€™m exploring how agents can learn from their environment by interacting with it, a field with immense potential in robotics, gaming, and decision-making systems.

## Tech I Use
- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **AI Tools**: Langchain, HuggingFace, Roboflow, Groq, LLMs
- **Cloud**: AWS (for deploying models and handling large datasets at scale)
- **Containerization**: Docker (to ensure reproducible research and scalable deployments)
- **Data Visualization**: Streamlit (to share research findings interactively) 
- **Version Control**: Git (for collaborating and maintaining codebases)

## Ongoing Projects
- **Explainability in AI**: I'm currently working on methods to make black-box AI models more interpretable without losing predictive power, leveraging techniques like SHAP and LIME.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing machine learning models to predict outcomes from complex datasets (e.g., time series, text, and image data) with high accuracy.
- **Algorithm Optimization**: Experimenting with novel optimization algorithms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning workflows.
